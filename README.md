# Telegram Chatbot
Made using [pyTelegramBotAPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyTelegramBotAPI/0.3.0/).
Still in development, hosted on my Raspberry Pi 4 ;)

# Functions:
* `/start` - To check if the bot is still working
* `/help`  - To find out what the bot can do 
* `/kick`  - Replying this command to a users message kick them out of the group (**Note** : U need to be an admin to kick them out)
* `#weatherUpdate cityName` - Gives the current weather in the city u input
* `#intNews` - Gives global news
* `#indNews` - Gives Indian news
* `#admins` - Replies with the list of admins in a group

Also wishes good night, and replies back when you initiate chat like "Hey" or "Hi"

Also has some small Easter eggs (try sending ok boomer)
